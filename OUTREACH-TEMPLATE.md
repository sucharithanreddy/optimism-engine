Dear Wysa Partnerships Team,

I hope this finds you well. I'm reaching out because I've built something that I believe could complement Wysa's mission of making mental health support accessible to everyone.

**The Opportunity:**

I've developed "The Optimism Engine" — an AI-powered CBT platform that achieves something most mental health chatbots struggle with: **deep, non-repetitive, emotionally intelligent conversations**.

After studying Wysa, Woebot, and other leaders, I noticed a common user complaint: "It feels like a tool, not a conversation." Users want to feel heard, not managed.

**What Makes This Different:**

| Feature | Typical AI Therapy | Optimism Engine |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Questions | Template-based | Generated in real-time based on emotion |
| Depth | Surface check-ins | 4-layer "Iceberg" progression (Surface → Trigger → Emotion → Core Belief) |
| Repetition | Common complaint | Tracks and never repeats questions |
| Personalization | Per-session only | Cross-session memory of topics, distortions, insights |

**Sample Interaction:**

*User:* "I feel worthless when people criticize me online"

*Optimism Engine:* "That must feel so heavy to carry around with you, like their words are leaving marks you can't quite wipe away. I wonder if you could start seeing these comments as background noise rather than truths about who you are..."

This is the level of warmth and depth users expect — and rarely get — from AI therapy.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Production-ready Next.js 16 application
- 7 AI provider integrations (no vendor lock-in)
- Security-hardened (protected APIs, rate limiting, input validation, CSP headers)
- Clerk authentication + Neon PostgreSQL
- 30+ beta users with strong feedback

**Why Wysa:**

I've admired Wysa's commitment to evidence-based, accessible mental health support. Rather than competing, I believe this technology could accelerate your roadmap — whether through acquisition, licensing, or partnership.

**What I'm Open To:**
- **Acquisition** — Full IP transfer, codebase, documentation, 30-day support
- **Licensing** — White-label for your platform
- **Partnership** — Technology collaboration

I'd welcome a 15-minute call to demo the platform and explore whether there's a fit. I'm happy to sign an NDA beforehand if preferred.

Documentation: Available upon request

Thank you for considering this. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

## Follow-Up (If No Response in 5 Days)

**Subject:** Re: Partnership Inquiry — Quick Follow-Up

Hi team,

Just following up on my previous note about the Optimism Engine AI CBT platform. I understand you're busy — if mental health AI acquisition/partnership isn't a current priority, no worries at all.

If it is, I'd still love to show you a 10-minute demo. The conversational depth is something that genuinely differentiates this from what's currently in market.

Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
[Your Name]
