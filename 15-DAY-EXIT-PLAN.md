### Indie Hackers Post

**Title:** [For Sale] AI Mental Health App - Deeper Than Wysa/Woebot - $35K Quick Exit

**Body:**
```
Hey IH community,

I've spent the last few months building an AI-powered CBT platform that solves 
the biggest complaint about mental health apps: shallow, repetitive conversations.

**What makes it different:**
- 🧊 "Iceberg" visual layer system (Surface → Trigger → Emotion → Core Belief) - unique
- 🎯 Dynamic emotion-responsive questions (generated in real-time, not templates)
- 🔄 Anti-repetition tracking (never asks same question twice)
- 💾 Cross-session memory (remembers past conversations)
- 🔒 Security-hardened + crisis detection built-in

**Tech stack:** Next.js 16, TypeScript, Clerk auth, Neon Postgres, 7 AI providers

**Why I'm selling:** Moving on to a new project, looking for quick exit to 
good home where this tech will actually be used to help people.

**Asking:** $35,000 (negotiable for quick close)
**Includes:** Full codebase, IP, documentation, 30-day support

Live demo: [your-url]

DM me or email: [your-email] for serious inquiries.
